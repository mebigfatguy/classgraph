classgraph
==========

a visualization of class dependencies


This is a JOGL application that shows a 3D visualization of dependencies between classes.
It shows classes as orbs of different colors:

    Green classes on the class path
    Red classes not on the class path
    White java.lang.Object


Classes with stronger relationships will cluster together.

Use the arrow keys to move around in the scene.
    LEFT/RIGHT to spin around the origin
    UP/DOWN to zoom in or zoom out
